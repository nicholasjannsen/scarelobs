This small piece of software can be used to quickly use imperical scaling relations for both observational and fundamental stellar parameters. These relations is directly from literature. An opdate for further use will follow, however, for no the software can be used to find effective temperatures from the observed colors and metallicities, and bolometric corrections from colors only.
